# Fictional Works

In this paper I discuss the puzzling phenomenon of fictional entities that manage to enter into the real world. Some literary works tell us of pieces of prose or literature written by fictional characters, of pieces of music composed originally in a story, or of a poem imaginatively conceived on a Sunday afternoon in an East-Sussex farmhouse that does not actually exist. It seems uncontroversial that all such _fictional works_ could be reproduced, performed or recited within the story that contains them. The tragic lines Briony writes in the opening chapter of McEwan's _Atonement_ are recited by her cousin a few pages later. 

> The play—for which Briony had designed the posters, pro-grams and tickets, constructed the sales booth out of a folding screen tipped on its side, and lined the collection box in red crêpe paper—was written by her in a two-day tempest of compo-sition, causing her to miss a breakfast and a lunch. When the preparations were complete, she had nothing to do but contemplate her finished draft and wait for the appearance of her cousins from the distant north.

But even further, to me it seems equally clear that those lines could just as well be presented to us outside the story. Can't I recite here the poem composed by a fictional character? Couldn't the London Review reproduce a letter that was written by and addressed to mere figments of the imagination? I think that it is obvious that if we got together and tried, we could at least make an attempt at performing -The Trials of Arabella', the play Briony wrote. In doing so, what seemed a fictional entity---a work created by a fictional character---manages with our help to enter into the actual world.

To my mind it is clear that this is a possibility. But it seems equally clear to me that there is something deeply puzzling about this. Typically, we assume that the world of the story and the actual world do not interact or are causally and historically insulated. In what follows I propose an explanation of this phenomenon. The explanation I want to propose points to the _abstract_ character of the works in question: all of them are _types_, artefacts created by people that allow, because of the kind of thing they are, for multiple instantiation. The main point I want to bring out is that the predicate 'fictional' and the qualification 'in the fiction'  do not apply at the level of types. But I show that this has the surprising consequence that some abstract entities can be invented by people that do not exist. 

# Authorship in fiction
The examples I mentioned all concern fictional characters that are presented as authors or artists in the story that contains them. In the story Briony writes a play, say, and she is presented explicitly as the author of that play. We could say that this makes it 'true in the fiction' that they wrote that play. But I think we can say more about their authorship. We conceive of the play as a particular that figures in the story, in more or less the way we conceive of Sherlock Holmes as a particular. Just as Sherlock Holmes was (presumably) born from specific parents, and so can be said to be the son of someone essentially, Briony's play is essentially her invention. It is part of the identity conditions of the play she wrote that is written by her---the play has that authorship essentially. (No doubt this can be made more precise, but it will do for now.)

Note that this does not imply that Briony _actually_ wrote that play, that she wrote it somewhere and at some time in the real world. She obviously didn't because she doesn't exist (assuming McEwan presented a fictional character). She wrote the play _in the story_, but this does not take away that her act of writing, her authorship, is part of our concept of that particular play, just as his having some parents is part of our conception of Sherlock Holmes. 

What I am trying to bring out here is that the claim 'Briony wrote it' would be true of the play if it somehow managed to emerge in the actual world, for example by being performed by a bunch of willing and charitable readers of McEwan's novel.  Perhaps we can bring out this feature in a formalisation using a fiction operator (FICT). The point is that 

1. FICT (Ex [Written by Briony]x)

Does not rule out that  

2. Ex (FICT [Written by Briony]x)
 
Imagine we perform Briony's play. We're staging a theatrical performance and enact the scenes she conceived in the story, we speak the lines she thought up for her characters. Here we have an instance of a work of theatre, we can see it and be amused or frustrated by it. But it is nonetheless true of this play that it was  only written by Briony in the fiction. In the actual world, _no one_ wrote that play.

The previous of course does not make the puzzle go away. But what it does do is remove one apparent way out that may have seemed attractive. This would be to propose that although we can perform the play in real life, when we do so it would not be true of the work we perform that Briony wrote it. The point is that this would be to have one's cake and eat it, which in this case does not seem possible. For, either we are not performing that particular play (merely a counterpart of it), or she did write it, be it in the fiction. We are working on the hypothesis that it is at least in principle possible to stage or print fictional works, and so should conclude that it is at least in principle possible that a fictional character wrote the play we staged. The important thing to realise is that this does not commit us to the claim that Briony wrote that play in the actual world. She didn't. All we need to acknowledge that it is actually true that Briony wrote that play in a fiction. 

# Resolving the puzzle: abstract entities and the reality/fiction divide

I want to suggest that it is because they are abstract that certain fictional entities are able to make the jump into the real world, with some help of course. 

Being abstract is not sufficient for this kind of fiction-to-world jump to be possible, however. In the next section I want to explain what more needs to be in place. 

# Notation

Nelson Goodman stressed the importance of notation in the arts. He suggested that it is only when works make use of notational systems that they can have clear identity criteria [check]. I do not wish to follow him in this claim, which has proven highly controversial [see @wollheim1980ab]. I want to highlight the role of notation in facilitating or enabling the fiction/real transfer discussed above. This is because abstractness in and of itself is not sufficient for transferability.

Abstract entities come in a variety of forms. What do an opera, the Volkswagen Beetle and an optical image have in common? The answer is that they allow for multiple instantiation at the same time. That is, we think of the Volkswagen as an abstract entity because at one and the same time we can find instances of the same car in a variety of locations, say in both Germany, Portugal and the Netherland Antilles. Similarly, Parsifal can be performed next Wednesday night both in Sydney and in New York (though in this case of course not simultaneously in the evening). Nelson Goodman argued that what makes a car count as an instance of a Beetle is different from what makes one instance of an opera count as an instance of Parsifal. (Note, the distinction here lies within the allographic, and shouldn't be conflated with the distinction between allographic and autographic. All allographic works of art are abstract, only some of them allow (or require) multiplication via notation.) He thought that for operas and many other works of art, it is conformity to score that makes for the identity of the instances (tokens) of the work (type). Now I have already said that I do not wish to follow Goodman on this point, but he is clearly pointing to a distinction we surely can accept. Some abstracta can be multiplied _via_ their scores or notational representations, while others cannot. 

We may think of a score as a formula or recipe. Follow these steps and one has created an instance of such and such a type. The steps in question are 'original'. In contrast, instances of other abstracta rely for their identity on some kind of historical lineage, some kind of magical transfer, some kind of shared past. Think of the pound coins in your wallet, all of these count as pound coins because they share their origin in an institution and were produced in a place that counts as metaphysically privileged or special in their histories. This is what Goodman saw rightly, I think. All he did was assume in addition a thesis about the insigifiance of the historical to identity. And that is a thesis I feel no need to accept. 

The point then is that it is only those types that can be multiplied _via_ notation (and it needs to be made more precise what this amounts to) that allow to be 'exported' from a fiction, precisely because here there is no need for an historical flow or shared history. All that is needed for such works is either actual conformity to a score (as Goodman had it) or just the intention to conform to a score (as Wollheim seems to hold). And both conditions surely can be fulfilled by our pack of eager actors trying to perform Briony's play in real life. 

Let me bring out once more why the autographic fictional work (say a sculpture), or the allographic non-notational one (say a copperplate engraving) is helpless without notation. Those works depend for their multiplication on their place in a shared history, whereas notational works are in some way liberated from that. (This needs to be spelled out much more carefully, and explained in much more detail.)

# The view that fictional entities are abstract objects

Some suggest that fictional entities or characters as such are abstract objects. Though not in obvious contradiction with what I said, this view sits ill with the way I have proposed to think of the situation. To my mind, it seems clear that Sherlock Holmes was intended as a concrete individual in the world of the fiction. What is gained by holding onto the idea that he is nonetheless an abstract entity?
