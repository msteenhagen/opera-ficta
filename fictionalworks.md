abstract: We can perform, execute, or generate instances of works created within a fiction, by merely fictional authors. This means that what happens in the fiction need not stay in the fiction. 
...

What happens in a fiction, stays in a fiction, right? Wrong. Some works of fiction tell us about pieces of prose or literature written by fictional characters. All such works are 'fictional works', as I'll call them; they are all works written, created or invented _within_ a fiction. Their authors are fictional characters: they are makers, creators, artists that do not exist (or at least the relevant acts of creation are fictional). Because of this, it seems, the works themselves are merely fictional, things that happen or exist merely according to a story. And yet we can perform, execute, or generate instances of such works. And so we could bring them into existence in the actual world. In such a case, what happens in a fiction, doesn't stay there.

I think this possibility has not received enough (if any) philosophical attention. In what follows I want to have a closer look at the pressure this example puts on the way we tend to conceive of the relation between fiction and reality. I will conclude that, given the status of plays, novels, and pieces of music as created, repeatable particulars, we need to give up a common assumption that particulars that find their origin in a fiction are encapsulated in the world of fiction.

# Fictional works vs Encapsulation

Let me begin with a specific example. Briony, the main character of Ian McEwan's _Atonement_, writes a play, _The Trials of Arabella_. We don't hear too much about it, but get a general sense of its plot, its main characters, and some of its most dramatic lines. What is made very clear: _The Trials of Arabella_ was written by Briony, and Briony alone. As McEwan describes:

> The play---for which Briony had designed the posters, programs and tickets, constructed the sales booth out of a folding screen tipped on its side, and lined the collection box in red crêpe paper---was written by her in a two-day tempest of composition, causing her to miss a breakfast and a lunch. When the preparations were complete, she had nothing to do but contemplate her finished draft and wait for the appearance of her cousins from the distant north [@mcewan0000aa,p. ??].

Although no doubt based on real people, Briony does not actually exist, at least not as the person she is. There exists no person that is Briony, the author of _The Trials of Arabella_, and nor could she actually exist. The author of _The Trials of Arabella_ is a merely fictional character. Her finished draft merely a fictional draft. And her sales booth too is merely a fictional one. Indeed, from the draft and sales booth she constructs in the course of the novel to the particular tears she sheds, everything that finds its origin in Briony's activity in the story is itself merely fictional. It inherits that fictionality from Briony [see also @nolan2014aa, p. 616]. Hence, there could not exist in the actual world something that is the product of her activity.

Or could there?

<!-- The Encapsulation thesis, widely endorsed, entails that no fictional particular can exist actually -->
It is common to assume that particulars that find their origin in a fiction are 'encapsulated' in the world of fiction. When we tell children that _Dracula_ is 'only a story', we build our words of comfort on this assumption. _It is not just that Dracula or Sherlock Holmes does not actually exist, it maintains that they could not actually exist._ What happened in the fiction, stays in the fiction.

This 'Encapsulation Thesis' (ET) is wide-spread, though not itself a topic of discussion. It's implicit in much of our thinking about fiction. I should note that the thesis does not rule out that Sherlock Holmes actually exists _as a fictional character_. Some authors have wished to claim that fictional characters actually exist, as some sort of cultural construction for example [e.g. @thomasson1999aa]. Such realism about fictional entities is compatible with the idea that Dracula is harmless, because according to the realist he can exist only as a fictional being. What the Encapsulation Thesis maintains is that the Dracula could not actually exist _as a blood-guzzling monster_.

The possibility of _fictional works_, such as Briony's _The Trials of Arabella_, presents us with potential counterexamples to ET. _The Trials_ is a particular work of theatre, written by Briony in a wholly fictional story. It seems uncontroversial that works written or composed in a fiction can also be performed in that fiction (as it turns out, the first performance in the McEwan's novel is only more than half a century after the play is written). We are very familiar with stories that tell us of the execution or performance of merely fictional works, and there does not seem anything strange about this [see also @hayaki2009aa, who focuses even on fictions in fictions in fictions]. It seems just as clear that Briony's play can be presented to an audience outside McEwan's story as well. And here I do not mean to an audience in _another_ story, as when a fictional entity that originates in one corpus makes a _cameo_, as it were, in another fictional work (_Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ (1988) thrives on such guest appearances). I mean that the play could just as well be performed by actual people, to an actual audience, on an actual stage. 

In other words, if you and I got together and tried, I don't see why we couldn't try performing _The Trials of Arabella_, the play Briony wrote, right now in the very room we're in.

On the face of it the play Bethany wrote is not a real play. Just as Sherlock Holmes is not a real detective or Dracula not a real vampire. Yet if we saw people on a stage trying to perform _The Trials_, giving voice to its lines and expression and life to its characters, wouldn't we be willing to say they were performing a play? Wouldn't we be willing to say that it was _The Trials_ they were performing? And wouldn't we be happy to attribute that play to Briony? If so, it seems, Briony's play would seem to be a fictional particular that has entered the actual world. A fictional thing would be performed right before our eyes. And an actual performance of a work is a sufficient condition for its actual existence.
 
So where does that leave us? I've suggested we can actually perform a fictional work such as _The Trials of Arabella_. If one can perform a fictional work, then a fictional particular can exist actually. But the Encapsulation thesis entails that no fictional particular can exist actually. Such fictions are supposed to be encapsulated. Now we shouldn't get too worried, as it seems still fine to trick children to believe ET if it makes them sleep better. But as a philosophical thesis about fiction ET is untenable. (I'll present this argument more formally a few pages down.)

# Against an argument against transfer

Is that it? Well, there may seem to be another way out. Someone critical of what I just said could suggest all I have identified is the _appearance_ of transfer, and not the real thing. They think that at best the play we perform _resembles_ the play Briony wrote---perhaps resembles it very closely indeed, but still.Instead of having a fictional play exist in the actual world, we would have an actual play that bears a close similarity to a play in the fiction.  

This line of reasoning can only be confidently maintained when an over-generalisation is made. _The Trials_ is written by Briony, a fictional particular. But not only is _The Trials_ a play written by a fictional particular, it itself is a fictional particular. It is a general truth about particulars, the critic contends, that they are bound to an historical setting. A particular is an entity placed at a point in time and space, and any form of travel or reproduction of it is necessarily bound to that same historical setting. 

There is something to this, no doubt. Think of a building. It is true that a _particular_ building erected in a fiction cannot be also erected in the actual world. It could be thought that at best we can make things that resemble the fictional entity. As a consequence of her fictionality, we can safely infer that the particular sales booth she constructed similarly does not and cannot exist in the actual world. At best we could encounter a sales booth quite like it, just as they could be persons in the actual world quite like Briony. But those very particulars are 'encapsulated' in the world of fiction. We cannot make the fictional entity. In these cases, transfer indeed is simply not possible. And so anything that purports to be a case of transfer of such particulars can at best be the appearance of transfer.

Of course, our example drives on the assumption that _The Trials_ is a repeatable particular. And as a repeatable particular, it is surely exempted from the strictures that confine Fictional Building, Sherlock Holmes, and the like? In fact that is not obvious, and it seems here that the plausibility of the alternative we're considering has its roots. Even if we turn to repeatable particulars, there is something to the line of thinking that also they are bound to a historical setting. 

Take an etching, for instance. This is what leads to the confidence of the claim that, as a _repeatable particular_, _The Trial_ is necessarily bound to its historical setting (now fictional) and hence encapsulated in the fiction. 

Plays, novels, and operas are _allographic_ repeatables, to use Goodman's term. Fictional novels, plays, and operas can be printed, performed and sung in real life. What may at first sight seem an _obstacle_ to their repetition in the real world, the fact that they are created merely in a fiction, is not an obstacle.  

Role of notation. That is what underpins the overgeneralisation, it ignores the role for notation in the generation of particulars of a type. Walters puts it nicely when he writes that for works as created types, "Further tokens can be generated, then, either by copying existing tokens, or else by producing tokens according to a recipe, or from storage." The point is that when such a type is  created in a fiction, it is not possible to copy it because of a historical discontinuity, but it is possible to produce a token according to a recipe. We need not follow Goodman in thinking that 'following a recipe' can be done quite accidentally, and instead may still assume that there is an important role for the intention of the individual who follows the recipe (e.g. produces a series of sounds that conform to a score).

And so a _type_ of building, invented in a fiction, could do this.

Although it is difficult to draw a sharp line, it is clear that the kinds of things we're talking about aren't marginal and sometimes quite prominent. Think of the science fiction novels of Jules Verne and others, that often have been credited with the invention of vessels and artefacts that only were actually constructed decades or centuries later.  

# Incapsulation is false: now what?

The explanation for this possibility has to do with the fact that a play is a _repeatable_ artefact, but repeatables of a specific sort. It is something created at a specific point in time, but it allows for instances of it to be generated in light of a set of rules or following a procedure, instead of a mere mechanical mind-less sort of reproduction. This raises interesting questions for the metaphysics of artefacts that I plan to pursue elsewhere.

What matters for a theory of fiction and of the place of fictional entities is the argument against Encapsulation. If the example shows a genuine possibility of transfer, and if transfer undermines Encapsulation, then Encapsulation has to give way.

What does this mean for our reliance on possible worlds to model what happens in a fiction? Back to the possible worlds. 

What does this mean for the reassurance we thought to have that monsters from a story can't come out to haunt us in real life? Back to the monsters. 

Fictional entities, within limits, can enter into the real world. Here I should mention that the converse is of course very familiar. Real things, people and the like can become the central characters in a fictional narrative. 

# A modally stronger premise

Earlier I said that for fictional particulars, typically, they do not exist and could not exist in the real world. I've shown that this is false as a general thesis, because some fictional particulars can exist in the real world. There is a question: once we have a fiction in which a play, say, is created, should we now say that this play also does exist in the actual world? That would render the revision of Encapsulation even more thorough-going. I think there's some reason to take also this seriously. 

At this point it is helpful to present my argument in a more formal way: 

1. _The Trials_ is a fictional particular 
2. _The Trials_ is a play 
3. Plays are repeatable particulars
4. If one can actually perform a repeatable particular, then that particular can actually exist
5. We can actually perform _The Trials_
6. Therefore, _The Trials_ can actually exist 
7. If ET is right, then a fictional particular cannot actually exist
8. Therefore, ET is not right 

Recall, the Encapsulation Thesis maintains not just that Sherlock Holmes does not actually exist, at least not as a detective, it maintains that he could not actually exist, at least not as a detective. 

An actual performance of a play suffices for that play to exist actually. So the if a play can possibly be actually performed, it possibly actually exists. So fa so good. Now we can make a further argument based on the following: 

1. _The Trials_ is a fictional particular 
2. _The Trials_ is a play 
3. Plays are repeatable particulars
4'. If one can actually perform a repeatable particular, then that particular __does__ actually exist
5. We can actually perform _The Trials_
6'. Therefore, _The Trials_ __does__ actually exist 
7. If ET is right, then a fictional particular cannot actually exist
8. Therefore, ET is not right 

This leaves the overall conclusion unaltered, but it seems to allow us to draw a stronger subconclusion in (6.).

So potentially the argument leads to an even bolder conclusion. This requires us to make a stronger assumption (4.). It exploits the assumption that: If one can perform play x, then x actually exists. This may seem incredible, but there is something to be said for it, as long as we understand 'can' in the right way (as always, 'can' needs to be understood in the right way). If by 'can perfom' we mean that the materials are available to us, i.e. we have access to the notation or can reasonably believe we have reconstructed (part of) the notation, then the assumption is acceptable, I think. And with that sense of 'can' in mind, Briony's play, or similar plays such as Hamlet's _The Mousetrap_, _can_ actually be performed. 

The conditional is acceptable because there are nights a particular play is not performed. Yet it doesn't cease to exist. Why not? Because it can still be performed, in just this sense of can. 

Lee Walters seems to be sympathetic to this reading. He writes that "types, even created types, can exist when they have no tokens", and goes on to suggest that all that is needed is that there is an 'embodiment' of the type. 

> It is the existence of the embodiment of a type that enables the production of (further) tokens of the type. What’s important for the existence of a type is, then, the possibility of generating tokens of that type---that is, that some embodiment of the type exists.[@walters2013aa, p. 463]

An embodiment is not itself a token, 

> the existence of a type is tied to the possibility of generating tokens of that type, by reference to an individual,‘which serves as a rule or standard for the production of others’. These individuals include both pre-existing tokens, like a sentence or a musical performance, and recipes for producing tokens of that type; recursion clauses for languages and musical scores are examples of recipes for producing tokens of a type, but are not themselves tokens of that type. In addition, types can be stored, for example, in memory, on a computer, or on film. Further tokens can be generated, then, either by copying existing tokens, or else by producing tokens according to a recipe, or from storage. [@walters2013aa, p. 462]

So the main message here is twofold. The first part is that __if it is possible to generate tokens of a type, then the type exists__. This we see captures what we wanted to express with (4'). As Walters writes, 

>  This picture is exactly what is required to capture the intuitive persistence conditions of repeatable artworks, such as musical works: they can come into existence through the writing of a score, and the preservation of a score is thereby the preservation of the work, regardless of whether the work is ever performed.[@walters2013aa, p. 476]

The second part is about what is presupposed in the antecedent. It is only possible to generate tokens of a type if an embodiment of the type exists. This is a necessary condition. And so, given that we clearly can perform _The Trials of Arabella_, an embodiment of that play must exist. And we don't have to search long to find it: it is contained ('stored', in a way) in McEwan's novel. 





An alternative way to go: the play is merely fictional as long as no tokens of it exist in the actual world. As soon as a token of the play exists in the actual world, the play itself exists (as a type) in the actual world. (Walters brings out how "what is required to avoid problems with the persistence of properties and repeatable artworks is to reject __The Strengthened Instantiation Principle__, and this can be done without embracing either The Weakened Principle of Instantiation or The Principle of Instantiation." This is relevant here as well. ) This entails that the play is not merely fictional. (Some plays, as types, on this line of thinking, of course, are merely actual.) This is an interesting suggestion or alternative, and it is useful to have a discussion of what could make us decide between this alternative and the earlier suggestion that the labels 'fictional' or 'real' do not apply at the level of types.

I've pointed to a phenomenon that seems very well possible. I've constructed an example based on a fictional work in one of McEwan's novels. We've seen that the phenomenon (and so the example) is puzzling in light of the distinction between fictional and real entities. I now want to suggest a way to resolve the puzzlement. It's an explanation of how it is possible for fictional entities of the sort I discussed to make their entrance into the real world. 

What is the explanation? In brief, i want to suggest that it is because they are abstract that certain fictional entities are able to make the jump into the real world, with some help of course.

The main point about novels, operas and the like is that they are repeatable. This is a pretheoretic datum, I think. We start out with the observation that some works allow for multiple instances, performances or incarnations, whereas others do not. The idea that some works are 'types' is a theoretical way of giving this prima facie difference a place in our theorising about the nature of works of art. So far so good. This is a story that has been told over and over again, and it does not in any way involve the phenomenon of fiction-to-world transgressions I identified above. In other words, the starting point of the explanation I want to defend is completely general, familiar, and widely accepted: some works of art allow for multiple instantiations. 

What fictional characters like Sherlock Holmes have in common with types is that, it seems, just as nothing really is Sherlock Holmes, nothing really the type. We conceive of fictional characters in the same way, and just as  ‘Sherlock Holmes’ may be a name without a referent, so may 'the Red Flag' be. (But it seems to me that if they indeed were without referents, they would be so for different reasons.)

It could be thought that something is created by x if and only if x brings the thing into existence. Given that Briony's play does not exist, she cannot have created it. This again is too quick. For, according to the fiction the play does of course exist, and so according to the fiction she has created it. This does help us identify where exactly these things start to bleed. For the facts about the existence of the type and facts about its authorship are fictional ones, all obtaining merely according to a fiction, at least at a first glance. It is only once instances start to show up in the real world that these facts become actual: suddenly the play performed exists also in the actual world, and was written by Briony. Interestingly, it remains true that the play was only written 'in the fiction', not in the actual world.

Being invited to go see a play written by a fictional personage in a fictional scenario would only be puzzling if we assumed that those works that allow for multiple instantiation only allow for instantiations in the world in which they were written, composed or otherwise created. On such an assumption it would seem impossible for a play written in a fictional scenario to be performed in a real-world setting. But of course the assumption is highly questionable, and in effect the examples discussed themselves put pressure on it. Why think that works that allow for multiple instantiation only allow for instantiations in the world in which they were written, composed or otherwise created?

In answer to this question, there _is_ indeed a good reason to think this. So much I admit. But I want to suggest it only holds for some of the repeatable works we are familiar with, not all. The reason that works that allow for multiple instantiation only allow for instantiations in the world in which they were created, the answer goes, is that instantiations depend for their identity (i.e. for their being instances of the works in question) on a causal/historical tie to some original plate, mould, or Ur-form, or to some original act of creation or conception. Without such a causal tie an object can at best be a simulacrum of an instantiation. And causal/historical ties cannot run between fictional worlds and the actual world.

I find this a good point. But to my mind, all it shows is that being abstract is not sufficient for the kind of fiction-to-world jump we've been interested in to be possible. It doesn't show that it is impossible, for it is not at all obvious that all instantiations of abstract works are in that way dependent on a causal/historical tie. In the next section I want to explain how there's an alternative route to instantiation, but also that this alternative route requires a work of art of a very specific sort.

# 'Natively fictional' 

> The creationist will want to draw a distinction between ‘native’ and ‘immigrant’ objects in a fiction: an ‘immigrant’ fictional object is one which came into existence due to a previously told fiction, or comes from the real world, while a ‘native’ fictional object, for a given fiction, is one which first appears in that fiction. This terminology is from Parsons (1980: 51–52). [@nolan2014aa, p. 617]

Science fiction is a genre that is full of fictional artefacts, things or products or inventions that do not actually exist. There is a way in which such artefacts can become reality as well. Jules Verne described the submarine, it seems, and the moon rocket. When he wrote these were merely fictional artefacts, but after his stories were published those things became realities as well. Did Verne invent the submarine? The orbital rocket? To me this is not as obvious as the case of plays or poetry. But it may be the right thing to think. It depends again on the role of scores, notations or prescriptions that needs to be followed in the process of generation of tokens. For some such fictional inventions, it seems that we do have reason to suggest that what got invented later were counterparts of the inventions in his story, unless of course he presented in his story the 'breakthrough' technology that made these things actually possible. (This point requires further elaboration.)
 
(A similar thing can be thought for the mathematical problem solved in Futurama. It seems the solution proposed by x was the breakthrough, and x was the first to solve the problem. This is an interesting case, and I don't really know what to say about it.)

# Conclusions

I've argued that either we can't perform Briony's play, or Incapsulation is false. I've further shown how there is a clear reason to think that we can perform Briony's play, a reason rooted in the notation of such works. 

A keen reader will by now have realised that there is something quite similar happening in the other direction. Also the actual world is able to bleed into the world of the fiction. In fact this is of course pervasive. I have not considered this until now because I think it's helpful here to look at things one at a time. But it is a good question how these two points relate. Are they instances of the same possibility? And if not what makes them different? 

All this tells us something about the place of such abstract objects. They neither belong to the actual world, nor to any possible world, but they hover strangely over them, so to say. They are like balloons let up by individuals, able to drift across borders.

I have said nothing about the view that all fictional entities are abstract objects. Some suggest that fictional entities or characters as such are abstract objects. Though not in obvious contradiction with what I said, this view sits ill with the way I have proposed to think of the situation. To my mind, it seems clear that Sherlock Holmes was intended as a concrete individual in the world of the fiction. What is gained by holding onto the idea that he is nonetheless an abstract entity? I will simply leave this issue hanging, as something to be sorted out by a defender of the thesis that all fictional entities are abstract objects.
