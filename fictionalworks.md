What happens in a fiction, stays in a fiction, right? Wrong. Some works of fiction tell us about pieces of prose or literature written by fictional characters. All such works are _fictional works_, as I'll call them; they are all works written, created or invented within a fiction. Their authors are fictional characters: they are makers, creators, artists that do not exist (or at least the relevant acts of creation are fictional). Because of this, it seems, the works themselves are merely fictional, things that happen or exist merely according to a story. And yet we can perform, execute, or generate instances of such works. And so we could bring those works into existence in the actual world. In such a case, something that happened in a fiction, doesn't stay there.

I think this possibility has not received enough (if any) philosophical attention. In what follows I want to have a closer look at the pressure this example puts on the way we tend to conceive of the relation between fiction and reality. I will conclude that, given the status of plays, novels, and pieces of music as created, repeatable particulars, we need to give up a common assumption that particulars that find their origin in a fiction are encapsulated in the world of fiction.

# Fiction and Encapsulation

Let me begin with a specific example. Briony, the main character of Ian McEwan's _Atonement_, writes a play, _The Trials of Arabella_. We don't hear too much about it in the book, but get a general sense of its plot, its main characters, and some of its most dramatic lines. I'll assume that one would have enough to go on to perform it. What is made very clear: _The Trials of Arabella_ was written by Briony, and Briony alone. As McEwan describes:

> The play---for which Briony had designed the posters, programs and tickets, constructed the sales booth out of a folding screen tipped on its side, and lined the collection box in red crÃªpe paper---was written by her in a two-day tempest of composition, causing her to miss a breakfast and a lunch. When the preparations were complete, she had nothing to do but contemplate her finished draft and wait for the appearance of her cousins from the distant north.

Although no doubt based on real people, Briony does not actually exist, at least not as the person she is. There exists no person that is Briony, the author of _The Trials of Arabella_, and nor could she actually exist, it seems; for, the author of _The Trials of Arabella_ is a merely fictional character. 

And not only Briony is. Also her finished draft is merely a fictional draft. And her sales booth too is merely a fictional one. Indeed, from the draft and sales booth she constructs to the particular tears she sheds, everything that finds its origin in Briony's activity in the story is itself merely fictional. It inherits that fictionality from Briony [see also @nolan2014aa, p. 616]. Hence, there could not exist in the actual world some particular that is the product of her activity.

Or could there?

It is common to assume that particulars that find their origin in a fiction are 'encapsulated' in the world of fiction. When we tell children that _Dracula_ is 'only a story', we build our words of comfort on this assumption. It is not just that Dracula or Sherlock Holmes do not actually exist, it is commonly assumed that they _could_ not actually exist. As I began, the credo is that what happens in the fiction, stays in the fiction.

This 'Encapsulation Thesis' underpins many of our beliefs and theories about fiction, and I take it to be a philosophically interesting and substantive thesis. I should note that the thesis, as I have formulated it, does not rule out that Sherlock Holmes actually exists _as a fictional character_. Some authors have wished to claim that fictional characters actually exist, as some sort of cultural construction for example [e.g. @thomasson1999aa]. Such realism about fictional entities is compatible with the idea that Dracula is harmless, because according to the realist he can actually exist only as a fictional being. What the Encapsulation Thesis maintains is that Dracula could not actually exist _as a blood-guzzling monster_, and that there could not actually be a London detective that is Sherlock Holmes.

The possibility of fictional works, such as Briony's _The Trials of Arabella_, presents us with potential counterexamples to the Encapsulation Thesis so formulated. 

_The Trials_ is a particular work of theatre, written by Briony in a wholly fictional story. It seems uncontroversial that works written or composed in a fiction can also be performed in that fiction. We are very familiar with stories that tell us of the execution or performance of merely fictional works, and there does not seem anything strange about this [see also @hayaki2009aa, who focuses even on the performance of fictions within fictions within fictions]. It seems just as clear that Briony's play can be presented to an audience outside McEwan's story as well. And here I do not mean to an audience in another fiction, as when a fictional entity that originates in one corpus makes a _cameo_ in another fictional work, as it were (think here of _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ (1988), which thrives on such guest appearances). No, I mean that the play could just as well be performed by actual people, to an actual audience, on an actual stage. 

On the face of it, the play Bethany wrote is not a real play, just as Sherlock Holmes is not a real detective or Dracula not a real vampire. Yet if we saw people on a stage trying to perform _The Trials_, giving voice to its lines and expression and life to its characters, wouldn't we be willing to say they were performing a play? Wouldn't we be willing to say that it was _The Trials_ they were performing? And wouldn't we be happy to attribute that play to Briony? I think we would. If so, then this suggests Briony's play would be a fictional particular that can enter the actual world. Such a fictional thing could be performed right before our eyes.
 
So where does that leave us? I've suggested we can actually perform a fictional work such as _The Trials of Arabella_. If one can perform a fictional work, then a fictional particular can exist actually. But the Encapsulation thesis entails that no fictional particular can exist actually. Such fictions are supposed to be encapsulated. 

We shouldn't get too worried; it seems still fine to trick children to believe the Encapsulation Thesis if it makes them sleep better. But as a philosophical thesis about fiction that thesis is untenable. (I'll present this argument more formally a few pages down.)

# Against an argument against transfer

Is that the end of the Encapsulation Thesis? There may seem to be another way out. Let us consider this for a moment. 

Someone critical of what I just said could object that all I have identified is the _appearance_ of transfer, and not the real thing. They think that a play we actually perform can at best _resemble_ the play Briony wrote. It can resemble it very closely indeed. But this does not take away that it is not the same play. Indeed, the critic I envisage brings in that it simply cannot be the same play. 

Why is this? The suggestion would be that it has to do with the play's particularity. We know _The Trials_ is written by Briony, a fictional particular. But not only is _The Trials_ a play written by a fictional particular, it itself is a fictional particular. It is a general truth about particulars that they are bound to an historical setting---or so the critic contends. A particular is an entity uniquely placed at a point in time and space. It can only travel, grow, be moved or reproduce into places and times connected with an original point it occupied. Assuming that each fiction---or perhaps fiction as such---makes its own distinct historical setting, it is impossible for such particulars to leap from fiction into reality. Because a purely fictional narrative unfolds in a distinct fictional universe, so to say, there do not run any spatio-temporal paths between such a fictional universe and the actual one. Therefore, we can safely infer that an actually performed play cannot be the very play that was written by Briony in McEwan's fictional narrative.  

There is something to this. But this line of reasoning can only be confidently developed as an objection to my argument when an over-generalisation is made. And I want to resist such over-generalisation.

Let me first say what is right about this observation. Particulars, at least as they are commonly conceived, are indeed tied to an historical setting in a peculiar and intimate way. Think of a building. It is built during a specific period of time, and at a specific location. Such spatiotemporal facts about it form part of the _thisness_ of any building. If we know of a building _x_ that it is located in a time and place building _A_ is not located, we can safely conclude that building _x_ and building _A_ are distinct. Any degree of resemblance between them is simply irrelevant to questions of particular identity. The Japanese are known for their replicas of Dutch houses, but no matter how well they manage to copy them, they will never manage to build one of the buildings erected in Holland in the Golden Age. For the same reason, a merely fictional building cannot be found in the actual world.

Now of course we have already seen that a play is not just any sort of particular. It is repeatable. And it may be thought that its repeatability liberates it from its historical situation. I think this would be too quick, and I think that this is what the current objection brings out nicely. For even repeatable particulars can be confined to their historical setting in a way that confirms the Encapsulation Thesis. Take an etching, for instance. There is no way you can hang a print in your house from an etching done by a merely fictional character. For it to be such a print, the paper would have had to touch their etching plate. And touching requires just that kind of historical path that is unavailable if we're talking about fiction. 

I suggested that if you and I got together and tried, there seems to be no good reason why in principle we couldn't perform _The Trials of Arabella_, the play Briony wrote, right now in the very room we're in. The objection now is that there is such a reason: particulars, even repeatable ones, are tied to their historical setting in a way that confines them to it. It seems that here particularity trumps repeatability.

Were it not for the role of notation. The objection assumes that instances of all repeatable particulars depend on a historical path from original to print or reproduction. Though that assumption is commonly made, it is is an overgeneralisation. At least as we typically conceive of them, for all repeatable works further instances can be generated either by mechanically copying from existing instances, or from an original plate or mould, _or else_ by producing instances by following a set of guidelines or recipe [cf. @walters2013aa, p. ??]. And so even if we cannot genuinely copy or reproduce an a repeatable work merely created in a fiction, we may still be able to generate instances of it by following a set of guidelines or recipe, if it comes with them. And some works come with such guidelines essentially. _Notation_ makes plays, novels, poems and the like into a special sort of repeatable particulars. They are _allographic_, to use Goodman's term. And even when fictionally created, such repeatables can be printed, performed or sung in real life, as long as their fictional scores or scripts are accessible. Ultimately, notation trumps particularity. 

# Encapsulation is false: now what?

The previous makes clear that there can be counterexamples to the Encapsulation Thesis not because fictional works can be repeatable particulars, but because they can be repeatable particulars of a specific, allographic sort. They can be particular things created at a specific point in a fictional history, and allow for instances to be generated in light of a set of rules or following a procedure. All that is required is that someone pick up that task, whether they themselves are merely fictional or not. I have explained how this entails that fictional works can break free from their historical setting in a way that is impossible for other sorts of particulars, such as people, buildings and etchings. 

I should flag briefly that this conclusion raises several interesting questions for the metaphysics of artefacts, but they are questions that do not fall within the purview of this paper.

For the moment I want to return to the theory of fiction and the status of fictional entities. If the example shows a genuine possibility of transfer, and if transfer undermines Encapsulation, then Encapsulation has to give way.

What does this mean for our reliance on possible worlds to model what happens in a fiction? Back to the possible worlds. 

What does this mean for the reassurance we thought to have that monsters from a story can't come out to haunt us in real life? Back to the monsters. 

Fictional entities, within limits, can enter into the real world. Here I should mention that the converse is of course very familiar. Real things, people and the like can become the central characters in a fictional narrative. 

# A modally stronger premise

Earlier I said that for fictional particulars, typically, they do not exist and could not exist in the real world. I combined a denial about facts with a denial about possibility or potentiality. I've shown that the claim is false as a general thesis, because some fictional particulars _can_ exist in the real world. The argument so far thus only builds on the possibility of actually existing fictional works. And that suffices for the dispute about the Encapsulation Thesis. 

Yet the argument gives rise to a closely related question that is worth pursuing. Once someone has actually created a fiction in which a play, say, is created, should we now say that this play also actually exists? That is, when McEwan completed _Atonement_, a novel about a young girl who writes _The Trials of Arabella_, did he thereby bring that play into existence as well? We've seen that as soon as we actually perform the play, the play actually exists. But could it be that it existed even before that, just in virtue of the completion of _Atonement_, the novel that contains the play's origination?

Although it may seem far-fetched at first, I think there's some reason to take also this seriously. To see this, it's helpful to look more closely at the premises of the argument I started with: 

1. _The Trials_ is a fictional particular 
2. _The Trials_, a fictional particular, is a play 
3. Plays are repeatable particulars
4. If one can actually perform a repeatable particular, then that particular can actually exist
5. We can actually perform _The Trials_, a fictional particular
6. _The Trials_, a fictional particular, can actually exist 

Recall, the Encapsulation Thesis maintains that Sherlock Holmes, because it is a merely fictional detective, cannot actually exist, at least not as a detective. And so we can use (6) to undermine the Encapsulation Thesis:

6. _The Trials_, a fictional particular, can actually exist
7. If the Encapsulation Thesis is right, then a fictional particular cannot actually exist
8. Therefore, the Encapsulation Thesis is not right 

The reasoning here is straightforward. In the previous I considered the 5th premise most controversial, and defended it against an objection. 

An actual performance of a play suffices for that play to exist actually. So the if a play can possibly be actually performed, it possibly actually exists. So far so good. Now we can make a further argument based on the following: 

1. _The Trials_ is a fictional particular 
2. _The Trials_ is a play 
3. Plays are repeatable particulars
4. * If one can actually perform a repeatable particular, then that particular __does__ actually exist
5. We can actually perform _The Trials_
6. * Therefore, _The Trials_ __does__ actually exist 

This leaves the overall conclusion unaltered, but it seems to allow us to draw a stronger subconclusion in (6.).

So potentially the argument leads to an even bolder conclusion. This requires us to make a stronger assumption (4.). It exploits the assumption that: If one can perform play x, then x actually exists. This may seem incredible, but there is something to be said for it, as long as we understand 'can' in the right way (as always, 'can' needs to be understood in the right way). If by 'can perfom' we mean that the materials are available to us, i.e. we have access to the notation or can reasonably believe we have reconstructed (part of) the notation, then the assumption is acceptable, I think. And with that sense of 'can' in mind, Briony's play, or similar plays such as Hamlet's _The Mousetrap_, _can_ actually be performed. 

The conditional is acceptable because there are nights a particular play is not performed. Yet it doesn't cease to exist. Why not? Because it can still be performed, in just this sense of can. 

Lee Walters seems to be sympathetic to this reading. He writes that "types, even created types, can exist when they have no tokens", and goes on to suggest that all that is needed is that there is an 'embodiment' of the type. 

> It is the existence of the embodiment of a type that enables the production of (further) tokens of the type. Whatâs important for the existence of a type is, then, the possibility of generating tokens of that type---that is, that some embodiment of the type exists.[@walters2013aa, p. 463]

An embodiment is not itself a token, 

> the existence of a type is tied to the possibility of generating tokens of that type, by reference to an individual,âwhich serves as a rule or standard for the production of othersâ. These individuals include both pre-existing tokens, like a sentence or a musical performance, and recipes for producing tokens of that type; recursion clauses for languages and musical scores are examples of recipes for producing tokens of a type, but are not themselves tokens of that type. In addition, types can be stored, for example, in memory, on a computer, or on film. Further tokens can be generated, then, either by copying existing tokens, or else by producing tokens according to a recipe, or from storage. [@walters2013aa, p. 462]

So the main message here is twofold. The first part is that __if it is possible to generate tokens of a type, then the type exists__. This we see captures what we wanted to express with (4'). As Walters writes, 

>  This picture is exactly what is required to capture the intuitive persistence conditions of repeatable artworks, such as musical works: they can come into existence through the writing of a score, and the preservation of a score is thereby the preservation of the work, regardless of whether the work is ever performed.[@walters2013aa, p. 476]

The second part is about what is presupposed in the antecedent. It is only possible to generate tokens of a type if an embodiment of the type exists. This is a necessary condition. And so, given that we clearly can perform _The Trials of Arabella_, an embodiment of that play must exist. And we don't have to search long to find it: it is contained ('stored', in a way) in McEwan's novel. 


# 'Natively fictional' 

> The creationist will want to draw a distinction between ânativeâ and âimmigrantâ objects in a fiction: an âimmigrantâ fictional object is one which came into existence due to a previously told fiction, or comes from the real world, while a ânativeâ fictional object, for a given fiction, is one which first appears in that fiction. This terminology is from Parsons (1980: 51â52). [@nolan2014aa, p. 617]

Science fiction is a genre that is full of fictional artefacts, things or products or inventions that do not actually exist. There is a way in which such artefacts can become reality as well. Jules Verne described the submarine, it seems, and the moon rocket. When he wrote these were merely fictional artefacts, but after his stories were published those things became realities as well. Did Verne invent the submarine? The orbital rocket? To me this is not as obvious as the case of plays or poetry. But it may be the right thing to think. It depends again on the role of scores, notations or prescriptions that needs to be followed in the process of generation of tokens. For some such fictional inventions, it seems that we do have reason to suggest that what got invented later were counterparts of the inventions in his story, unless of course he presented in his story the 'breakthrough' technology that made these things actually possible. (This point requires further elaboration.)
 
(A similar thing can be thought for the mathematical problem solved in Futurama. It seems the solution proposed by x was the breakthrough, and x was the first to solve the problem. This is an interesting case, and I don't really know what to say about it.)

# Conclusions

I've argued that either we can't perform Briony's play, or Incapsulation is false. I've further shown how there is a clear reason to think that we can perform Briony's play, a reason rooted in the notation of such works. 

Although it is difficult to draw a sharp line, it is clear that the kinds of things we're talking about aren't marginal and sometimes quite prominent. And so a _type_ of building, invented in a fiction, could do this. Think of the science fiction novels of Jules Verne and others, that often have been credited with the invention of vessels and artefacts that only were actually constructed decades or centuries later.  

A keen reader will by now have realised that there is something quite similar happening in the other direction. Also the actual world is able to bleed into the world of the fiction. In fact this is of course pervasive. I have not considered this until now because I think it's helpful here to look at things one at a time. But it is a good question how these two points relate. Are they instances of the same possibility? And if not what makes them different? 

All this tells us something about the place of such abstract objects. They neither belong to the actual world, nor to any possible world, but they hover strangely over them, so to say. They are like balloons let up by individuals, able to drift across borders.

I have said nothing about the view that all fictional entities are abstract objects. Some suggest that fictional entities or characters as such are abstract objects. Though not in obvious contradiction with what I said, this view sits ill with the way I have proposed to think of the situation. To my mind, it seems clear that Sherlock Holmes was intended as a concrete individual in the world of the fiction. What is gained by holding onto the idea that he is nonetheless an abstract entity? I will simply leave this issue hanging, as something to be sorted out by a defender of the thesis that all fictional entities are abstract objects.
