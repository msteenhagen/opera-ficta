# Fictional Works

In this paper I discuss the puzzling phenomenon of fictional entities that manage to enter into the real world. Some literary works tell us of pieces of prose or literature written by fictional characters, of pieces of music composed originally in a story, or of a poem imaginatively conceived on a Sunday afternoon in an East-Sussex farmhouse that does not actually exist. It seems uncontroversial that all such _fictional works_ could be reproduced, performed or recited within the story that contains them. The tragic lines Bethany writes in the opening chapter of McEwan's _Atonement_ are recited by her cousin a few pages later. But even further, to me it seems equally clear that those lines could just as well be presented to us outside the story. Can't I recite here the poem composed by a fictional character? Couldn't the London Review reproduce a letter that was written by and addressed to mere figments of the imagination? I think that it is obvious that if we got together and tried, we could at least make an attempt at performing the play Bethany wrote. In doing so, what seemed a fictional entity---a work created by a fictional character---manages with our help to enter into the actual world.

To my mind it is clear that this is a possibility. But it seems equally clear to me that there is something deeply puzzling about this. Typically, we assume that the world of the story and the actual world do not interact or are causally and historically insulated. In what follows I propose an explanation of this phenomenon. The explanation I want to propose points to the _abstract_ character of the works in question: all of them are _types_, artefacts created by people that allow, because of the kind of thing they are, for multiple instantiation. The main point I want to bring out is that the predicate 'fictional' and the qualification 'in the fiction'  do not apply at the level of types. But I show that this has the surprising consequence that some abstract entities can be invented by people that do not exist. 

# Authorship in fiction
The examples I mentioned all concern fictional characters that are presented as authors or artists in the story that contains them. In the story Bethany writes a play, say, and she is presented explicitly as the author of that play. We could say that this makes it 'true in the fiction' that they wrote that play. But I think we can say more about their authorship. We conceive of the play as a particular that figures in the story, in more or less the way we conceive of Sherlock Holmes as a particular. Just as Sherlock Holmes was (presumably) born from specific parents, and so can be said to be the son of someone essentially, Bethany's play is essentially her invention. It is part of the identity conditions of the play she wrote that is written by her---the play has that authorship essentially. (No doubt this can be made more precise, but it will do for now.)

Note that this does not imply that Bethany _actually_ wrote that play, that she wrote it somewhere and at some time in the real world. She obviously didn't because she doesn't exist (assuming McEwan presented a fictional character). She wrote the play _in the story_, but this does not take away that her act of writing, her authorship, is part of our concept of that particular play, just as his having some parents is part of our conception of Sherlock Holmes. 

What I am trying to bring out here is that the claim 'Bethany wrote it' would be true of the play if it somehow managed to emerge in the actual world, for example by being performed by a bunch of willing and charitable readers of McEwan's novel.  Perhaps we can bring out this feature in a formalisation using a fiction operator (FICT). The point is that 

1. FICT (Ex [Written by Bethany]x)

Does not rule out that  

2. Ex (FICT [Written by Bethany]x)
 
Imagine we perform Bethany's play. We're staging a theatrical performance and enact the scenes she conceived in the story, we speak the lines she thought up for her characters. Here we have an instance of a work of theatre, we can see it and be amused or frustrated by it. But it is nonetheless true of this play that it was  only written by Bethany in the fiction. In the actual world, _no one_ wrote that play.

The previous of course does not make the puzzle go away. But what it does do is remove one apparent way out that may have seemed attractive. This would be to propose that although we can perform the play in real life, when we do so it would not be true of the work we perform that Bethany wrote it. The point is that this would be to have one's cake and eat it, which in this case does not seem possible. For, either we are not performing that particular play (merely a counterpart of it), or she did write it, be it in the fiction. We are working on the hypothesis that it is at least in principle possible to stage or print fictional works, and so should conclude that it is at least in principle possible that a fictional character wrote the play we staged. The important thing to realise is that this does not commit us to the claim that Bethany wrote that play in the actual world. She didn't. All we need to acknowledge that it is actually true that Bethany wrote that play in a fiction.
