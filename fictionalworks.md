1. How much do I need to build into 'abstract'? I start with repeatable, which I take to be pretheoretical. Can I leave it at that? 
2. What are the precise sub-theses of each of the sections, and how do they comprise the argument of the paper? Make this precise.

Can fictional entities manage to enter into the real world? In this paper I discuss a puzzling phenomenon where just this seems to happen. Some authors of literary works tell us of pieces of prose or literature written by fictional characters. Some stories are about pieces of music composed originally by a protagonist, or about a poem imaginatively conceived on a Sunday afternoon in an East-Sussex farmhouse that does not exist in real life. All such works are 'fictional works'---works written, created or invented _within_ a fiction. Their authors are fictional characters. They are makers, creator, artists that do not exist. 

Briony, a main character in McEwan's _Atonement_, is a clear example.  

> The play---for which Briony had designed the posters, programs and tickets, constructed the sales booth out of a folding screen tipped on its side, and lined the collection box in red crÃªpe paper---was written by her in a two-day tempest of composition, causing her to miss a breakfast and a lunch. When the preparations were complete, she had nothing to do but contemplate her finished draft and wait for the appearance of her cousins from the distant north [@mcewan0000aa,p. ??].

The tragic lines Briony writes in the opening chapter of the book are rehearsed by her cousin a few pages later. It seems uncontroversial that a _fictional work_ (not to be confused with a work of fiction) could be reproduced, performed or recited within the story that contains it [see also @hayaki2009aa, who focuses on fictions in fictions, and investigates their nested structure using iterative fiction operators]. Indeed, that is just what Briony expects her cousins to do. But to me it seems equally clear that Briony's play can equally well be presented to an audience outside the story. The play turns out a failure in the novel, and gets never performed in the story. But to me it seems obvious that if we all got together and tried, we could at least make an attempt at performing _The Trials of Arabella_, the play Briony wrote, for the first time. A work composed within a fiction would in such a case see its premiere on a real-world stage. 

This possibility of 'fiction-to-world bleeding', as we could call it, seems quite general (though how far it reaches, we will see, is itself an interesting question). For example, couldn't I recite here the poem composed by a fictional character? And couldn't the London Review reproduce a letter that was written by and addressed to mere figments of the imagination? I think so. In all such cases, what seemed a fictional entity---a work created by a fictional character---would manage with our help to enter into the actual world. A fictional stanza may resound in the very room you're in. A fictional play may be performed by real people. A fictional libretto may be sung and recorded in an actual studio.

Let us assume that this is right, and that we've identified a possible phenomenon. Fictional works probably have been realised many times. But isn't there is something deeply puzzling about such cases? 

On the face of it the play Bethany wrote is not a real play. Just as Sherlock Holmes is not a real detective or the Boogie Person is not a real monster, Briony's play does not seem to be created in the actual world. Yet if we saw people on a stage trying to perform _The Trials_, giving voice to its lines and expression and life to its characters, wouldn't we be willing to say they were performing a play? Wouldn't we be willing to say that it was _The Trials_ they were performing? And wouldn't we be happy to attribute that play to Briony? If so, it seems, Briony's play would also not seem fictional to us, as it would be performed right before our eyes. he puzzle is that we have just as much reason to deny that the play performed on the stage is fictional as we have reason to deny that it is real.

In what follows I propose an explanation of this phenomenon. The explanation I want to propose points to the _abstract_ character of the works in question: all of them are _types_, artefacts created by people that allow, because of the kind of thing they are, for multiple instantiation. My point I hope will make good sense, and is not far fetched at all. I want to bring out is that the predicate 'fictional' or 'real' and the qualification 'in the fiction' or 'in the real world' do not apply at the level of types (this is very tentative and needs revision).

## Authorship in fiction
The examples I mentioned all concern fictional characters that are presented as authors or artists in the story that contains them. In the story Briony writes a play, say, and she is presented explicitly as the author of that play. We could say that this makes it 'true in the fiction' that they wrote that play. But I think we can say more about their authorship. We conceive of the play as a particular that figures in the story, in more or less the way we conceive of Sherlock Holmes as a particular (more or less; they are significantly different, as I will explain later. @hayaki2009aa, p.381 equates them too easily, I think). Just as Sherlock Holmes was (presumably) born from specific parents, and so can be said to be the son of someone essentially, Briony's play is essentially her invention. It is part of the identity conditions of the play she wrote that is written by her---the play has that authorship essentially. (No doubt this can be made more precise, but it will do for now.)

Note that this does not imply that Briony _actually_ wrote that play, that she wrote it somewhere and at some time in the real world. She obviously didn't because she doesn't exist (assuming McEwan presented a fictional character). She wrote the play _in the story_, but this does not take away that her act of writing, her authorship, is part of our concept of that particular play, just as his having some parents is part of our conception of Sherlock Holmes. 

What I am trying to bring out here is that the claim 'Briony wrote it' would be true of the play if it somehow managed to emerge in the actual world, for example by being performed by a bunch of willing and charitable readers of McEwan's novel.  Perhaps we can bring out this feature in a formalisation using a fiction operator (FICT). The point is that 

1. FICT (Ex [Written by Briony]x)

Does not rule out that  

2. Ex (FICT [Written by Briony]x)
 
Imagine we perform Briony's play. We're staging a theatrical performance and enact the scenes she conceived in the story, we speak the lines she thought up for her characters. Here we have an instance of a work of theatre, we can see it and be amused or frustrated by it. But it is nonetheless true of this play that it was  only written by Briony in the fiction. In the actual world, _no one_ wrote that play.

The previous of course does not make the puzzle go away. But what it does do is remove one apparent way out that may have seemed attractive. This would be to propose that although we can perform the play in real life, when we do so it would not be true of the work we perform that Briony wrote it. The point is that this would be to have one's cake and eat it, which in this case does not seem possible. For, either we are not performing that particular play (merely a counterpart of it), or she did write it, be it in the fiction. We are working on the hypothesis that it is at least in principle possible to stage or print fictional works, and so should conclude that it is at least in principle possible that a fictional character wrote the play we staged. The important thing to realise is that this does not commit us to the claim that Briony wrote that play in the actual world. She didn't. All we need to acknowledge that it is actually true that Briony wrote that play in a fiction. 

## Resolving the puzzle: abstract entities and the reality/fiction divide

I've pointed to a phenomenon that seems very well possible. I've constructed an example based on a fictional work in one of McEwan's novels. We've seen that the phenomenon (and so the example) is puzzling in light of the distinction between fictional and real entities. I now want to suggest a way to resolve the puzzlement. It's an explanation of how it is possible for fictional entities of the sort I discussed to make their entrance into the real world. 

What is the explanation? In brief, i want to suggest that it is because they are abstract that certain fictional entities are able to make the jump into the real world, with some help of course.

The claim that plays, novels, operas and the like are abstract is familiar. It is commonly held that such works are _types_. But it is controversial. It is controversial because this would seem to require abstract entities to be created at some point in time. I think that those sceptical of this possibility are in the grip of an overgeneralisation (see @walters2012aa for a clear diagnosis of this mistake). Several authors have defended the idea that a play or a novel is a repeatable type that was created by someone at some point in time. I find that idea plausible, it captures well the idea that such works are repeatable and that they are created. 

Note, however, I do not think that the explanation I need to defend here needs to be very specific about the sort of abstracta novels or operas are. Indeed, it would be unwelcome if the explanation we arrive at was dressed up with the wardrobe of very specific positions in the philosophy of art if those specific positions were not themselves entailed by the possibility of the kind of fiction/reality transgressions I identified above. (A bit abstractly phrased, this, but we get the point: I want to take care not to make assumptions unnecessarily.) Here's Walters on this point:

> The claim that repeatable artworks are types which are created constitutes the bare-bones of a type-creationist treatment of repeatable artworks, a treatment that can be fleshed out in numerous ways. [@walters2012aa, p. ??]

What I do here is take on board the obvious claim that repeatable artworks are types, and I will assume for the sake of argument that they are created ones. That is as far as I need to go. I think that, as uncreated types, it is fairly obvious that such works allow for instances in the actual world as well as in the world of the fiction. It really is a 'creationist' attitude towards repeatable works that presents us with the puzzle. This is because as created types such works seem tied to a history or world in a way that makes it unclear how they could escape it.

The main point about novels, operas and the like is that they are repeatable. This is a pretheoretic datum, I think. We start out with the observation that some works allow for multiple instances, performances or incarnations, whereas others do not. The idea that some works are 'types' is a theoretical way of giving this prima facie difference a place in our theorising about the nature of works of art. So far so good. This is a story that has been told over and over again, and it does not in any way involve the phenomenon of fiction-to-world transgressions I identified above. In other words, the starting point of the explanation I want to defend is completely general, familiar, and widely accepted: some works of art allow for multiple instantiations. 

It could be thought that something is created by x if and only if x brings the thing into existence. Given that Briony's play does not exist, she cannot have created it. This again is too quick. For, according to the fiction the play does of course exist, and so according to the fiction she has created it. This does help us identify where exactly these things start to bleed. For the facts about the existence of the type and facts about its authorship are fictional ones, all obtaining merely according to a fiction, at least at a first glance. It is only once instances start to show up in the real world that these facts become actual: suddenly the play performed exists also in the actual world, and was written by Briony. Interestingly, it remains true that the play was only written 'in the fiction', not in the actual world.

Being invited to go see a play written by a fictional personage in a fictional scenario would only be puzzling if we assumed that those works that allow for multiple instantiation only allow for instantiations in the world in which they were written, composed or otherwise created. On such an assumption it would seem impossible for a play written in a fictional scenario to be performed in a real-world setting. But of course the assumption is highly questionable, and in effect the examples discussed themselves put pressure on it. Why think that works that allow for multiple instantiation only allow for instantiations in the world in which they were written, composed or otherwise created?

In answer to this question, there _is_ indeed a good reason to think this. So much I admit. But I want to suggest it only holds for some of the repeatable works we are familiar with, not all. The reason that works that allow for multiple instantiation only allow for instantiations in the world in which they were created, the answer goes, is that instantiations depend for their identity (i.e. for their being instances of the workd in question) on a causal/historical tie to some original plate, mould, or Ur-form, or to some original act of creation or conception. Without such a causal tie an object can at best be a simulacrum of an instantiation. And causal/historical ties cannot run between fictional worlds and the actual world.

I find this a good point. But to my mind, all it shows is that being abstract is not sufficient for the kind of fiction-to-world jump we've been interested in to be possible. It doesn't show that it is impossible, for it is not at all obvious that all instantiations of abstract works are in that way dependent on a causal/historical tie. In the next section I want to explain how there's an alternative route to instantiation, but also that this alternative route requires a work of art of a very specific sort.

## Notation

Nelson Goodman stressed the importance of notation in the arts. He suggested that it is only when works make use of notational systems that they can have clear identity criteria [check]. I do not wish to follow him in this claim, which has proven highly controversial [see @wollheim1980ab]. I want to highlight the role of notation in facilitating or enabling the fiction/real transfer discussed above. This is because abstractness in and of itself is not sufficient for transferability.

Abstract entities come in a variety of forms. What do an opera, the Volkswagen Beetle and an optical image have in common? The answer is that they allow for multiple instantiation at the same time. That is, we think of the Volkswagen as an abstract entity because at one and the same time we can find instances of the same car in a variety of locations, say in both Germany, Portugal and the Netherland Antilles. Similarly, Parsifal can be performed next Wednesday night both in Sydney and in New York (though in this case of course not simultaneously in the evening). Nelson Goodman argued that what makes a car count as an instance of a Beetle is different from what makes one instance of an opera count as an instance of Parsifal. (Note, the distinction here lies within the allographic, and shouldn't be conflated with the distinction between allographic and autographic. All allographic works of art are abstract, only some of them allow (or require) multiplication via notation.) He thought that for operas and many other works of art, it is conformity to score that makes for the identity of the instances (tokens) of the work (type). Now I have already said that I do not wish to follow Goodman on this point, but he is clearly pointing to a distinction we surely can accept. Some abstracta can be multiplied _via_ their scores or notational representations, while others cannot. 

We may think of a score as a formula or recipe. Follow these steps and one has created an instance of such and such a type. The steps in question are 'original'. In contrast, instances of other abstracta rely for their identity on some kind of historical lineage, some kind of magical transfer, some kind of shared past. Think of the pound coins in your wallet, all of these count as pound coins because they share their origin in an institution and were produced in a place that counts as metaphysically privileged or special in their histories. This is what Goodman saw rightly, I think. All he did was assume in addition a thesis about the insignificance of the historical to identity. And that is a thesis I feel no need to accept, at least not as a general thesis about types of works.  

The point then is that it is only those types that can be multiplied _via_ notation (and it needs to be made more precise what this amounts to) that allow to be 'exported' from a fiction, precisely because here there is no need for an historical flow or shared history. All that is needed for such works is either actual conformity to a score (as Goodman had it) or just the intention to conform to a score (as Wollheim seems to hold). And both conditions surely can be fulfilled by our pack of eager actors trying to perform Briony's play in real life. 

Walters puts it nicely when he writes that for works as created types, "Further tokens can be generated, then, either by copying existing tokens, or else by producing tokens according to a recipe, or from storage." The point is that when such a type is  created in a fiction, it is not possible to copy it because of a historical discontinuity, but it is possible to produce a token according to a recipe. We need not follow Goodman in thinking that 'following a recipe' can be done quite accidentally, and instead may still assume that there is an important role for the intention of the individual who follows the recipe (e.g. produces a series of sounds that conform to a score).

Let me bring out once more why the autographic fictional work (say a sculpture), or the allographic non-notational one (say a copperplate engraving) is helpless without notation. Those works depend for their multiplication on their place in a shared history, whereas notational works are in some way liberated from that. (This needs to be spelled out much more carefully, and explained in much more detail.)

## 'Real' and 'Fictional'

I now want to argue that the play Briony wrote was neither real nor fictional in the way Ian McEwan is real and Sherlock Holmes fictional. This is (in part?) because a play is not a concrete particular but an abstract one. The situation is this: we've got two predicates that typically are taken to be exclusive (contraries). If some x is fictional, it isn't real, and if it is real it isn't fictional. But are they also contradictories? That is, if we know something isn't real, do we know it's fictional and vice versa? I think this is not the case. Not all unreal things are fictions, it seems. The highest prime number, for example, doesn't exist but it isn't a fictional entity either. (Are all possibilia either real or fictional? Also not, I think, but that point needs further defence.)

An alternative way to go: the play is merely fictional as long as no tokens of it exist in the actual world. As soon as a token of the play exists in the actual world, the play itself exists (as a type) in the actual world. This entails that the play is not merely fictional. (Some plays, as types, on this line of thinking, of course, are merely actual.) This is an interesting suggestion or alternative, and it is useful to have a discussion of what could make us decide between this alternative and the earlier suggestion that the labels 'fictional' or 'real' do not apply at the level of types.  

## Some further thoughts

Science fiction is a genre that is full of fictional artefacts, things or products or inventions that do not actually exist. There is a way in which such artefacts can become reality as well. Jules Verne described the submarine, it seems, and the moon rocket. When he wrote these were merely fictional artefacts, but after his stories were published those things became realities as well. Did Verne invent the submarine? The orbital rocket? To me this is not obvious. It seems that here we do have reason to suggest that what got invented later were counterparts of the inventions in his story, unless of course he presented in his story the 'breakthrough' technology that made these things actually possible. (This point requires further elaboration.)

## The view that fictional entities are abstract objects

Some suggest that fictional entities or characters as such are abstract objects. Though not in obvious contradiction with what I said, this view sits ill with the way I have proposed to think of the situation. To my mind, it seems clear that Sherlock Holmes was intended as a concrete individual in the world of the fiction. What is gained by holding onto the idea that he is nonetheless an abstract entity?
