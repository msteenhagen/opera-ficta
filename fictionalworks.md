In this paper I discuss the puzzling phenomenon of fictional entities that manage to enter into the real world. Some literary works tell us of pieces of prose or literature written by fictional characters, of pieces of music composed originally in a story, or of a poem imaginatively conceived on a Sunday afternoon in an East-Sussex farmhouse that does not actually exist. It seems uncontroversial that all such _fictional works_ (not to be confused with works of fiction) could be reproduced, performed or recited within the story that contains them [see also @hayaki2009aa, who focuses on fictions in fictions, and investigates their nested structure using iterative fiction operators]. 

Here's a clear example. The tragic lines Briony writes in the opening chapter of McEwan's _Atonement_ are recited by her cousin a few pages later. 

> The play---for which Briony had designed the posters, programs and tickets, constructed the sales booth out of a folding screen tipped on its side, and lined the collection box in red crÃªpe paper---was written by her in a two-day tempest of composition, causing her to miss a breakfast and a lunch. When the preparations were complete, she had nothing to do but contemplate her finished draft and wait for the appearance of her cousins from the distant north [@mcewan0000aa,p. ??].

It should be obvious that it is possible for a story to be about the performance of a play created by a fictional character. To me it seems equally clear that such a play---that Briony's lines, say---may just as well be presented to us outside the story. A fictional play may be performed by real people. 

I think that it is obvious that if we got together and tried, we could at least make an attempt at performing -The Trials of Arabella', the play Briony wrote. And this possibility of fiction-to-world bleeding seems quite general. Why couldn't I recite here the poem composed by a fictional character? And why couldn't the London Review reproduce a letter that was written by and addressed to mere figments of the imagination? In all such cases, what seemed a fictional entity---a work created by a fictional character---would manage with our help to enter into the actual world.

To my mind it is clear that we've identified a possibile phenomenon. It probably has been realised many times. But it seems equally clear to me that there is something deeply puzzling about such cases. On the face of it the play Bethany wrote is a _fictional_ work: it is not real, just as Sherlock Holmes or the Boggie Person is not real. Typically, we assume that the world of the story and the actual world do not interact or are causally and historically insulated, and so it seems that those entities couldn't escape their fictional confines. 

In what follows I propose an explanation of this phenomenon. The explanation I want to propose points to the _abstract_ character of the works in question: all of them are _types_, artefacts created by people that allow, because of the kind of thing they are, for multiple instantiation. The main point I want to bring out is that the predicate 'fictional' and the qualification 'in the fiction'  do not apply at the level of types. I show that this has the surprising consequence that some abstract entities can be invented by people that do not exist. 

## Authorship in fiction
The examples I mentioned all concern fictional characters that are presented as authors or artists in the story that contains them. In the story Briony writes a play, say, and she is presented explicitly as the author of that play. We could say that this makes it 'true in the fiction' that they wrote that play. But I think we can say more about their authorship. We conceive of the play as a particular that figures in the story, in more or less the way we conceive of Sherlock Holmes as a particular (more or less; they are significantly different, as I will explain later. @hayaki2009aa, p.381 equates them too easily, I think). Just as Sherlock Holmes was (presumably) born from specific parents, and so can be said to be the son of someone essentially, Briony's play is essentially her invention. It is part of the identity conditions of the play she wrote that is written by her---the play has that authorship essentially. (No doubt this can be made more precise, but it will do for now.)

Note that this does not imply that Briony _actually_ wrote that play, that she wrote it somewhere and at some time in the real world. She obviously didn't because she doesn't exist (assuming McEwan presented a fictional character). She wrote the play _in the story_, but this does not take away that her act of writing, her authorship, is part of our concept of that particular play, just as his having some parents is part of our conception of Sherlock Holmes. 

What I am trying to bring out here is that the claim 'Briony wrote it' would be true of the play if it somehow managed to emerge in the actual world, for example by being performed by a bunch of willing and charitable readers of McEwan's novel.  Perhaps we can bring out this feature in a formalisation using a fiction operator (FICT). The point is that 

1. FICT (Ex [Written by Briony]x)

Does not rule out that  

2. Ex (FICT [Written by Briony]x)
 
Imagine we perform Briony's play. We're staging a theatrical performance and enact the scenes she conceived in the story, we speak the lines she thought up for her characters. Here we have an instance of a work of theatre, we can see it and be amused or frustrated by it. But it is nonetheless true of this play that it was  only written by Briony in the fiction. In the actual world, _no one_ wrote that play.

The previous of course does not make the puzzle go away. But what it does do is remove one apparent way out that may have seemed attractive. This would be to propose that although we can perform the play in real life, when we do so it would not be true of the work we perform that Briony wrote it. The point is that this would be to have one's cake and eat it, which in this case does not seem possible. For, either we are not performing that particular play (merely a counterpart of it), or she did write it, be it in the fiction. We are working on the hypothesis that it is at least in principle possible to stage or print fictional works, and so should conclude that it is at least in principle possible that a fictional character wrote the play we staged. The important thing to realise is that this does not commit us to the claim that Briony wrote that play in the actual world. She didn't. All we need to acknowledge that it is actually true that Briony wrote that play in a fiction. 

## Resolving the puzzle: abstract entities and the reality/fiction divide

I've pointed to a phenomenon that seems very well possible. I've constructed an example based on a fictional work in one of McEwan's novels. We've seen that the phenomenon (and so the example) is puzzling in light of the distinction between fictional and real entities. I now want to suggest a way to resolve the puzzlement. It's an explanation of how it is possible for fictional entities of the sort I discussed to make their entrance into the real world. 

What is the explanation? In brief, i want to suggest that it is because they are abstract that certain fictional entities are able to make the jump into the real world, with some help of course.

The claim that plays, novels, operas and the like are abstract is familiar. But it is controversial. (Some maintain that fictional entities as such are abstract. Also that claim is controverial. I will discuss this claim later on.) In particular, several authors have defended the idea that a play or a novel is a repeatable type. I find that idea plausible, but I do not think that the explanation I need to defend here needs to be very specific about the sort of abstracta novels or operas are. Indeed, it would be unwelcome if the explanation we arrive at was dressed up with the wardrobe of very specific positions in the philosophy of art if those specific positions were not themselves entailed by the possibility of the kind of fiction/reality transgressions I identified above. (A bit abstractly phrased, this, but we get the point: I want to take care not to make assumptions unnecessarily.)

The main point about novels, operas and the like is that they are repeatable. This is a pretheoretic datum, I think. We start out with the observation that some works allow for multiple instances, performances or incarnations, whereas others do not. The idea that some works are 'types' is a theoretical way of giving this prima facie difference a place in our theorising about the nature of works of art. So far so good. This is a story that has been told over and over again, and it does not in any way involve the phenomenon of fiction-to-world transgressions I identified above. In other words, the starting point of the explanation I want to defend is completely general, familiar, and widely accepted: some works of art allow for multiple instantiations. 

Being invited to go see a play written by a fictional personage in a fictional scenario would only be puzzling if we assumed that those works that allow for multiple instantiation only allow for instantiations in the world in which they were written, composed or otherwise created. On such an assumption it would seem impossible for a play written in a fictional scenario to be performed in a real-world setting. But of course the assumption is highly questionable, and in effect the examples discussed themselves put pressure on it. Why think that works that allow for multiple instantiation only allow for instantiations in the world in which they were written, composed or otherwise created?

In answer to this question, there is indeed a good reason to think this. But I want to suggest it only holds for some of the repeatable works we are familiar with, not all. The reason that works that allow for multiple instantiation only allow for instantiations in the world in which they were created, the answer goes, is that instantiations depend for their identity (i.e. for their being instances of the workd in question) on a causal/historical tie to some original plate, mould, or Ur-form, or to some original act of creation or conception. Without such a causal tie an object can at best be a simulacrum of an instantiation. And causal/historical ties cannot run between fictional worlds and the actual world.

I find this a good point. But to my mind, all it shows is that being abstract is not sufficient for the kind of fiction-to-world jump we've been interested in to be possible. It doesn't show that it is impossible, for it is not at all obvious that all instantiations of abstract works are in that way dependent on a causal/historical tie. In the next section I want to explain how there's an alternative route to instantiation, but also that this alternative route requires a work of art of a very specific sort.

## Notation

Nelson Goodman stressed the importance of notation in the arts. He suggested that it is only when works make use of notational systems that they can have clear identity criteria [check]. I do not wish to follow him in this claim, which has proven highly controversial [see @wollheim1980ab]. I want to highlight the role of notation in facilitating or enabling the fiction/real transfer discussed above. This is because abstractness in and of itself is not sufficient for transferability.

Abstract entities come in a variety of forms. What do an opera, the Volkswagen Beetle and an optical image have in common? The answer is that they allow for multiple instantiation at the same time. That is, we think of the Volkswagen as an abstract entity because at one and the same time we can find instances of the same car in a variety of locations, say in both Germany, Portugal and the Netherland Antilles. Similarly, Parsifal can be performed next Wednesday night both in Sydney and in New York (though in this case of course not simultaneously in the evening). Nelson Goodman argued that what makes a car count as an instance of a Beetle is different from what makes one instance of an opera count as an instance of Parsifal. (Note, the distinction here lies within the allographic, and shouldn't be conflated with the distinction between allographic and autographic. All allographic works of art are abstract, only some of them allow (or require) multiplication via notation.) He thought that for operas and many other works of art, it is conformity to score that makes for the identity of the instances (tokens) of the work (type). Now I have already said that I do not wish to follow Goodman on this point, but he is clearly pointing to a distinction we surely can accept. Some abstracta can be multiplied _via_ their scores or notational representations, while others cannot. 

We may think of a score as a formula or recipe. Follow these steps and one has created an instance of such and such a type. The steps in question are 'original'. In contrast, instances of other abstracta rely for their identity on some kind of historical lineage, some kind of magical transfer, some kind of shared past. Think of the pound coins in your wallet, all of these count as pound coins because they share their origin in an institution and were produced in a place that counts as metaphysically privileged or special in their histories. This is what Goodman saw rightly, I think. All he did was assume in addition a thesis about the insigifiance of the historical to identity. And that is a thesis I feel no need to accept. 

The point then is that it is only those types that can be multiplied _via_ notation (and it needs to be made more precise what this amounts to) that allow to be 'exported' from a fiction, precisely because here there is no need for an historical flow or shared history. All that is needed for such works is either actual conformity to a score (as Goodman had it) or just the intention to conform to a score (as Wollheim seems to hold). And both conditions surely can be fulfilled by our pack of eager actors trying to perform Briony's play in real life. 

Let me bring out once more why the autographic fictional work (say a sculpture), or the allographic non-notational one (say a copperplate engraving) is helpless without notation. Those works depend for their multiplication on their place in a shared history, whereas notational works are in some way liberated from that. (This needs to be spelled out much more carefully, and explained in much more detail.)

## 'Real' and 'Fictional'

I now want to argue that the play Briony wrote was neither real nor fictional in the way Ian McEwan is real and Sherlock Holmes fictional. This is (in part?) because a play is not a concrete particular but an abstract one. The situation is this: we've got two predicates that typically are taken to be exclusive (contraries). If some x is fictional, it isn't real, and if it is real it isn't fictional. But are they also contraditories? That is, if we know something isn't real, do we know it's ficional and vice versa? I think this is not the case. Not all unreal things are fictions, it seems. The highest prime number, for example, doesn't exist but it isn't a fictional entity either. (Are all possibilia either real or fictional? Also not, I think, but that point needs further defence.)

## Some further thoughts

Science fiction is a genre that is full of fictional artefacts, things or products or inventions that do not actually exist. There is a way in which such artefacts can become reality as well. Jules Verne described the submarine, it seems, and the moon rocket. When he wrote these were merely fictional artefacts, but after his stories were published those things became realities as well. Did Verne invent the submarine? The orbital rocket? To me this is not obvious. It seems that here we do have reason to suggest that what got invented later were counterparts of the inventions in his story, unless of course he presented in his story the 'breakthrough' technology that made these things actually possible. (This point requires further elaboration.)

## The view that fictional entities are abstract objects

Some suggest that fictional entities or characters as such are abstract objects. Though not in obvious contradiction with what I said, this view sits ill with the way I have proposed to think of the situation. To my mind, it seems clear that Sherlock Holmes was intended as a concrete individual in the world of the fiction. What is gained by holding onto the idea that he is nonetheless an abstract entity?
