abstract: We can perform, execute, or generate instances of works created within a fiction, by merely fictional authors. This means that what happens in the fiction need not stay in the fiction.

# Opening 

What happens in a fiction, stays in a fiction, right? Wrong. Some works of fiction tell us about pieces of prose or literature written by fictional characters. All such works are 'fictional works', as I'll call them; they are all works written, created or invented _within_ a fiction. Their authors are fictional characters: they are makers, creators, artists that do not exist (or at least the relevant acts of creation are fictional). Because of this, it seems, the works themselves are merely fictional, things that happen or exist merely according to a story. And yet we can perform, execute, or generate instances of such works. And so we could bring them into existence in the actual world. In such a case, what happens in a fiction, doesn't stay there.

I think this possibility has not received enough (if any) philosophical attention. In what follows I want to have a closer look at the pressure this example puts on the way we tend to conceive of the relation between fiction and reality. I will conclude that, given the status of plays, novels, and pieces of music as created, repeatable particulars, we need to give up a common assumption that particulars that find their origin in a fiction are encapsulated in the world of fiction. This, I suggest, has implications for the adequacy of a possible-world model of fiction.

# Fictional works vs Encapsulation

<!-- We can perform fictional works -->
Let me begin with a specific example. Briony, the main character of Ian McEwan's _Atonement_, writes a play, _The Trials of Arabella_. We don't hear too much about it, but get a general sense of its plot, its main characters, and some of its most dramatic lines. What is made very clear: _The Trials of Arabella_ was written by Briony, and Briony alone. As McEwan describes:

> The play---for which Briony had designed the posters, programs and tickets, constructed the sales booth out of a folding screen tipped on its side, and lined the collection box in red crêpe paper---was written by her in a two-day tempest of composition, causing her to miss a breakfast and a lunch. When the preparations were complete, she had nothing to do but contemplate her finished draft and wait for the appearance of her cousins from the distant north [@mcewan0000aa,p. ??].

Although no doubt based on real people, Briony does not actually exist, at least not as the person she is. _There exists no person that is Briony, nor could that person actually exist._ Briony is a merely fictional character. And so is her finished draft merely a fictional draft. And her sales booth too is a fictional one. From the draft and sales booth she constructs in the course of the narrative to every particular tear she sheds, every particular thing that finds its origin in Briony's activity in the story is merely fictional. There could not exist in the actual world something that is that sales booth, or that tear. Or so it seems.

<!-- The Encapsulation thesis, widely endorsed, entails that no fictional particular can exist actually -->
Particulars that find their origin in a fiction are encapsulated in the world of fiction. When we tell children that something is 'only a story', we build our words of comfort on this assumption. _For any particular that has its origin solely in a story, there exists nothing identical to it, nor could there exist something identical to it._ What happens in the fiction, stays in the fiction. The grip this Encapsulation Thesis (ET) has on us is reflected in the wide-spread conviction that the relation between the real world and the world of fiction may be modelled on the relation between the actual world and possible worlds.

<!-- To perform a fictional work is to make a fictional particular exist actually -->
Fictional works such as Briony's _The Trials of Arabella_ are counterexamples to ET. _The Trials of Arabella_ is a particular work of theatre, written by Briony in a wholly fictional story. It seems uncontroversial that works written or composed in a fiction can also be performed in that fiction (as it turns out, the first performance in the story is only more than half a century later, close to the end). We are very familiar with stories that tell us of the execution or performance of merely fictional works, and there does not seem anything strange about this [see also @hayaki2009aa, who focuses on fictions in fictions, and investigates their nested structure using iterative fiction operators]. Yet it seems equally clear that Briony's play can just as well be presented to an audience outside McEwan's story. And here I do not mean to an audience in _another_ story, as when a fictional entity that originates in one corpus makes a _cameo_, as it were, in another fictional work. I mean that the play could just as well be performed by actual people, to an actual audience, on an actual stage. If some of us got together and tried, I don't see why we couldn't try performing _The Trials of Arabella_, the play Briony wrote, right now in this very room.

On the face of it the play Bethany wrote is not a real play. Just as Sherlock Holmes is not a real detective or the Bogeyperson is not a real monster, Briony's play does not seem to be a creature of the actual world. Yet if we saw people on a stage trying to perform _The Trials_, giving voice to its lines and expression and life to its characters, wouldn't we be willing to say they were performing a play? Wouldn't we be willing to say that it was _The Trials_ they were performing? And wouldn't we be happy to attribute that play to Briony? If so, it seems, Briony's play would seem to be a fictional particular that has entered the actual world. A fictional thing would be performed right before our eyes. And to perform a fictional work, is to make it exist actually.
 
So where does that leave us? I've suggested we can actually perform a fictional work such as _The Trials of Arabella_. If one can perform a fictional work, then a fictional particular can exist actually. But the Encapsulation thesis entails that no fictional particular can exist actually. Such fictions are supposed to be encapsulated. Now we shouldn't get too worried, as it seems still fine to trick children to believe ET if it makes them sleep better. But as a philosophical thesis about fiction ET is untenable.

# Against an argument against transfer


I now want to address an line of reasoning that seems to offer a way out. On this line all I have identified is the _appearance_ of transfer, and not the real thing. That is, we would merely appear to perform _The Trials_ in our little experiment, but in fact do nothing more than perform a play that closely resembles _The Trials_. 

To understand this line of reasoning, it is helpful briefly to list the relevant assumptions that form the backdrop of my discussion.

1. _The Trials_ cannot actually exist
2. _The Trials_ is a play
3. Plays are repeatable particulars
4. We can actually perform _The Trials_
5. If one can actually perform a particular play, then that play can actually exist

The first assumption, that _The Trials_ cannot actually exist, seems to follow from the Encapsulation Thesis together with the fact that _The Trials_ finds its origin in a fiction. _The Trials_ obviously is a play, at least according to the fiction, as obviously as Sherlock Holmes is a detective. The third assumption seems equally clear to me (though some people have wished to deny it). Plays are historical artefacts that allow for multiple instantiations. Also the fifth assumption seems straightforward, and follows simply from the nature of repeatable types. If one can build a Buick car, then a Buick car can actually exist---one can be _run over_ by a Buick, which simply proves that it actually exists.

It is the fourth assumption that may seem most controversial. Can we can actually perform _The Trials_? It could be suggested that because _The Trials_ is a _particular_ (cf. 2,3), and to wit a fictional one, at best the real world can include a play that is just like _The Trials_, in the way Pierre Menard's story is just like Cervantes' _Don Quixote_ but not the same story. 

This line of reasoning can only be confidently maintained when an over-generalisation is made. It is true that a _particular_ building erected in a fiction cannot be also erected in the actual world. It could be thought that at best we can make things that resemble the fictional entity. As a consequence of her fictionality, we can safely infer that the particular sales booth she constructed similarly does not and cannot exist in the actual world. At best we could encounter a sales booth quite like it, just as they could be persons in the actual world quite like Briony. But those very particulars are 'encapsulated' in the world of fiction. We cannot make the fictional entity. The example shows no transfer. No transfer, only resemblance. 

At least one of these assumptions needs to give way. I'm suggesting it's the first. The current line of reasoning suggests it is only the fourth. We cannot actually perform _The Trials_, only a play just like it.

Now it is true that the example deals with repeatable works, but also for repeatable works it seems that the reasoning holds. Similarly etching, for instance. This is what leads to confidence. 

But with a play.

Role of notation. That is what underpins the overgeneralisation, it ignores the role for notation in the generation of particulars of a type. 

And so a _type_ of building, invented in a fiction, could do this.

Although it is difficult to draw a sharp line, it is clear that the kinds of things we're talking about aren't marginal and sometimes quite prominent. Think of the science fiction novels of Jules Verne and others, that often have been credited with the invention of vessels and artefacts that only were actually constructed decades or centuries later.  

# Incapsulation is false: now what?

If the example shows a genuine possibility of transfer, and if transfer undermines Encapsulation, then Encapsulation has to give way.

What does this mean for our reliance on possible worlds to model what happens in a fiction? Back to the possible worlds. 

What does this mean for the reassurance we thought to have that monsters from a story can't come out to haunt us in real life? Back to the monsters. 

Fictional entities, within limits, can enter into the real world. Here I should mention that the converse is of course very familiar. Real things, people and the like can become the central characters in a fictional narrative. 

# A modally stronger premise

Earlier I said that for fictional particulars, typically, they do not exist and could not exist in the real world. I've shown that this is false as a general thesis, because some fictional particulars can exist in the real world. There is a question: once we have a fiction in which a play, say, is created, should we now say that this play also does exist in the actual world? That would render the revision of Encapsulation even more thorough-going. I think there's some reason to take also this seriously. Recall, these were the assumptions I spelled out earlier: 

1. _The Trials_ cannot actually exist
2. _The Trials_ is a play
3. Plays are repeatable particulars
4. We can actually perform _The Trials_
5. If one can actually perform a particular play, then that play can actually exist

An actual performance of a play suffices for that play to exist actually. So the if a play can possibly be actually performed, it possibly actually exists. So fa so good. Now we can make a further argument based on the following: 

1. _The Trials_ do not actually exist
2. _The Trials_ is a play
3. Plays are repeatable particulars
4. We can actually perform _The Trials_
5. If one can actually perform a particular play, then that play actually exists

The argument leads to an even bolder conclusion. It rests on stronger assumptions. In particular, it exploits the assumption that: If one can perform play x, then x actually exists. This may seem incredible, but there is something to be said for it, as long as we understand 'can' in the right way (as always, 'can' needs to be understood in the right way). If by 'can perfom' we mean that the materials are available to us, i.e. we have access to the notation or can reasonably believe we have reconstructed (part of) the notation, then the assumption is acceptable, I think. And with that sense of 'can' in mind, Briony's play, or similar plays such as Hamlet's _The Mousetrap_, _can_ actually be performed. 

The conditional is acceptable because there are nights a particular play is not performed. Yet it doesn't cease to exist. Why not? Because it can still be performed, in just this sense of can. 




It seems to me that the explanation for this possibility has to do with the fact that a play is a _repeatable_ artefact. It is something created at a specific point in time, but it allows for instances of it to be generated. 

I've pointed to a phenomenon that seems very well possible. I've constructed an example based on a fictional work in one of McEwan's novels. We've seen that the phenomenon (and so the example) is puzzling in light of the distinction between fictional and real entities. I now want to suggest a way to resolve the puzzlement. It's an explanation of how it is possible for fictional entities of the sort I discussed to make their entrance into the real world. 

What is the explanation? In brief, i want to suggest that it is because they are abstract that certain fictional entities are able to make the jump into the real world, with some help of course.

The main point about novels, operas and the like is that they are repeatable. This is a pretheoretic datum, I think. We start out with the observation that some works allow for multiple instances, performances or incarnations, whereas others do not. The idea that some works are 'types' is a theoretical way of giving this prima facie difference a place in our theorising about the nature of works of art. So far so good. This is a story that has been told over and over again, and it does not in any way involve the phenomenon of fiction-to-world transgressions I identified above. In other words, the starting point of the explanation I want to defend is completely general, familiar, and widely accepted: some works of art allow for multiple instantiations. 

What fictional characters like Sherlock Holmes have in common with types is that, it seems, just as nothing really is Sherlock Holmes, nothing really the type. We conceive of fictional characters in the same way, and just as  ‘Sherlock Holmes’ may be a name without a referent, so may 'the Red Flag' be. (But it seems to me that if they indeed were without referents, they would be so for different reasons.)

It could be thought that something is created by x if and only if x brings the thing into existence. Given that Briony's play does not exist, she cannot have created it. This again is too quick. For, according to the fiction the play does of course exist, and so according to the fiction she has created it. This does help us identify where exactly these things start to bleed. For the facts about the existence of the type and facts about its authorship are fictional ones, all obtaining merely according to a fiction, at least at a first glance. It is only once instances start to show up in the real world that these facts become actual: suddenly the play performed exists also in the actual world, and was written by Briony. Interestingly, it remains true that the play was only written 'in the fiction', not in the actual world.

Being invited to go see a play written by a fictional personage in a fictional scenario would only be puzzling if we assumed that those works that allow for multiple instantiation only allow for instantiations in the world in which they were written, composed or otherwise created. On such an assumption it would seem impossible for a play written in a fictional scenario to be performed in a real-world setting. But of course the assumption is highly questionable, and in effect the examples discussed themselves put pressure on it. Why think that works that allow for multiple instantiation only allow for instantiations in the world in which they were written, composed or otherwise created?

In answer to this question, there _is_ indeed a good reason to think this. So much I admit. But I want to suggest it only holds for some of the repeatable works we are familiar with, not all. The reason that works that allow for multiple instantiation only allow for instantiations in the world in which they were created, the answer goes, is that instantiations depend for their identity (i.e. for their being instances of the works in question) on a causal/historical tie to some original plate, mould, or Ur-form, or to some original act of creation or conception. Without such a causal tie an object can at best be a simulacrum of an instantiation. And causal/historical ties cannot run between fictional worlds and the actual world.

I find this a good point. But to my mind, all it shows is that being abstract is not sufficient for the kind of fiction-to-world jump we've been interested in to be possible. It doesn't show that it is impossible, for it is not at all obvious that all instantiations of abstract works are in that way dependent on a causal/historical tie. In the next section I want to explain how there's an alternative route to instantiation, but also that this alternative route requires a work of art of a very specific sort.

The point I have wanted to make in this section is that because plays, novels, and operas allow are repeatables, fictional novels, plays, and operas can be printed, performed and sung in real life. What seemed an _obstacle_ to this, the fact that they are created merely in a fiction, is not an obstacle. And this is telling. What does it tell? It tells us something about the place of such abstract objects. They neither belong to the actual world, nor to any possible world, but they hover strangely over them, so to say. They are like balloons let up by individuals, able to drift across borders. 

## 'Natively fictional' 

Introduce and define notion of being natively fictional, and show how some native fictional things can inhabit our world. Perhaps Jules Verne? Mathematical problem solved in Futurama.

## Plays as created types?

Comment on framework of created types, which I have assumed to be correct.

The claim that plays, novels, operas and the like are abstract is familiar. It is commonly held that such works are _types_. But it is controversial. It is controversial because this would seem to require abstract entities to be created at some point in time. I think that those sceptical of this possibility are in the grip of an overgeneralisation (see @walters2012aa for a clear diagnosis of this mistake). Several authors have defended the idea that a play or a novel is a repeatable type that was created by someone at some point in time. I find that idea plausible, it captures well the idea that such works are repeatable and that they are created. 

Note, however, I do not think that the explanation I need to defend here needs to be very specific about the sort of abstracta novels or operas are. Indeed, it would be unwelcome if the explanation we arrive at was dressed up with the wardrobe of very specific positions in the philosophy of art if those specific positions were not themselves entailed by the possibility of the kind of fiction/reality transgressions I identified above. (A bit abstractly phrased, this, but we get the point: I want to take care not to make assumptions unnecessarily.) Here's Walters on this point:

> The claim that repeatable artworks are types which are created constitutes the bare-bones of a type-creationist treatment of repeatable artworks, a treatment that can be fleshed out in numerous ways. [@walters2012aa, p. ??]

What I do here is take on board the obvious claim that repeatable artworks are types, and I will assume for the sake of argument that they are created ones. That is as far as I need to go. I think that, as uncreated types, it is fairly obvious that such works allow for instances in the actual world as well as in the world of the fiction. It really is a 'creationist' attitude towards repeatable works that presents us with the puzzle. This is because as created types such works seem tied to a history or world in a way that makes it unclear how they could escape it.

## Notation

Nelson Goodman stressed the importance of notation in the arts. He suggested that it is only when works make use of notational systems that they can have clear identity criteria [check]. I do not wish to follow him in this claim, which has proven highly controversial [see @wollheim1980ab]. I want to highlight the role of notation in facilitating or enabling the fiction/real transfer discussed above. This is because abstractness in and of itself is not sufficient for transferability.

Abstract entities come in a variety of forms. What do an opera, the Volkswagen Beetle and an optical image have in common? The answer is that they allow for multiple instantiation at the same time. That is, we think of the Volkswagen as an abstract entity because at one and the same time we can find instances of the same car in a variety of locations, say in both Germany, Portugal and the Netherland Antilles. Similarly, Parsifal can be performed next Wednesday night both in Sydney and in New York (though in this case of course not simultaneously in the evening). Nelson Goodman argued that what makes a car count as an instance of a Beetle is different from what makes one instance of an opera count as an instance of Parsifal. (Note, the distinction here lies within the allographic, and shouldn't be conflated with the distinction between allographic and autographic. All allographic works of art are abstract, only some of them allow (or require) multiplication via notation.) He thought that for operas and many other works of art, it is conformity to score that makes for the identity of the instances (tokens) of the work (type). Now I have already said that I do not wish to follow Goodman on this point, but he is clearly pointing to a distinction we surely can accept. Some abstracta can be multiplied _via_ their scores or notational representations, while others cannot. 

We may think of a score as a formula or recipe. Follow these steps and one has created an instance of such and such a type. The steps in question are 'original'. In contrast, instances of other abstracta rely for their identity on some kind of historical lineage, some kind of magical transfer, some kind of shared past. Think of the pound coins in your wallet, all of these count as pound coins because they share their origin in an institution and were produced in a place that counts as metaphysically privileged or special in their histories. This is what Goodman saw rightly, I think. All he did was assume in addition a thesis about the insignificance of the historical to identity. And that is a thesis I feel no need to accept, at least not as a general thesis about types of works.  

The point then is that it is only those types that can be multiplied _via_ notation (and it needs to be made more precise what this amounts to) that allow to be 'exported' from a fiction, precisely because here there is no need for an historical flow or shared history. All that is needed for such works is either actual conformity to a score (as Goodman had it) or just the intention to conform to a score (as Wollheim seems to hold). And both conditions surely can be fulfilled by our pack of eager actors trying to perform Briony's play in real life. 

Walters puts it nicely when he writes that for works as created types, "Further tokens can be generated, then, either by copying existing tokens, or else by producing tokens according to a recipe, or from storage." The point is that when such a type is  created in a fiction, it is not possible to copy it because of a historical discontinuity, but it is possible to produce a token according to a recipe. We need not follow Goodman in thinking that 'following a recipe' can be done quite accidentally, and instead may still assume that there is an important role for the intention of the individual who follows the recipe (e.g. produces a series of sounds that conform to a score).

When we talk about abstracta, we can talk about universals or particulars. If we talk about universals, then fiction/reality transgressions seem uncontroversial. The quantity of cups on the table may be the number of dwarfs that aid Snow White, my tie may have the colour of Alice's apron in the Looking Glass, your nose may have the shape of that of captain Aleb's in Moby Dick. But if we talk about abstract particulars, then we are talking about entities that have an historical dimension. (Goodman denied this, and in effect treated novels and operas as universals. On his picture, it should be obvious that we can perform Briony's play.) The Buick was invented at some point in time, and so instances of it could not predate its invention, for example. Mere qualitative identity does not suffice for instantiation of an abstract particular; the historical setting must be right as well. It is for this reason that some abstract particulars cannot 'jump worlds', so to say, and in particular cannot jump from fictions to reality. If novels and operas are abstract particulars, then their notational character liberates them, and allows them to break free from their fictional settings. 

Let me briefly sum up where this leaves us. We're concerned with repeatable artworks that figure in a fiction. The question is, can instances of such works make their way into the real world? I noted that if we conceive of repeatable works as 'pure universals', there is nothing strange or controversial about the idea. This is because something instantiates a pure universal already if it has the right qualitaties: the identity of such universals is a matter of mere resemblance. It is only if we think that these repeatable artworks are not pure universals but created types. I explained why it is compelling to think that they are, but it should then be clear that the puzzle becomes pressing. As created types, I explained, works can allow their instances to be produced by copying or imprinting or some other form of historical 'sympathy' (there is an interesting tie between these forms of production and forms of magic as described most famously by Frazer). But other created types are such that their instances can be generated simply by following a score or recipe. I suggested that this kind of following seems to be more than just accidental conformation, and has an intentional component. However, I suggested, this intentional component does not presuppose the kind of historical contiguity that is presupposed by the sympathetic model. So it is not right to think that tokens of all created types must trace an historical chain. When there's a score or recipe, the intention to follow that recipe ('the recipe for producing an instance of this type') may be sufficient for the production of a token, when successful to a relevant degree. 

## 'Real' and 'Fictional'

I now want to argue that the play Briony wrote was neither real nor fictional in the way Ian McEwan is real and Sherlock Holmes fictional. This is (in part?) because a play is not a concrete particular but an abstract one. The situation is this: we've got two predicates that typically are taken to be exclusive (contraries). If some x is fictional, it isn't real, and if it is real it isn't fictional. But are they also contradictories? That is, if we know something isn't real, do we know it's fictional and vice versa? I think this is not the case. Not all unreal things are fictions, it seems. The highest prime number, for example, doesn't exist but it isn't a fictional entity either. (Are all possibilia either real or fictional? Also not, I think, but that point needs further defence.)

An alternative way to go: the play is merely fictional as long as no tokens of it exist in the actual world. As soon as a token of the play exists in the actual world, the play itself exists (as a type) in the actual world. (Walters brings out how "what is required to avoid problems with the persistence of properties and repeatable artworks is to reject The Strengthened Instantiation Principle, and this can be done without embracing either The Weakened Principle of Instantiation or The Principle of Instantiation." This is relevant here as well. ) This entails that the play is not merely fictional. (Some plays, as types, on this line of thinking, of course, are merely actual.) This is an interesting suggestion or alternative, and it is useful to have a discussion of what could make us decide between this alternative and the earlier suggestion that the labels 'fictional' or 'real' do not apply at the level of types.  

## Some further thoughts

Science fiction is a genre that is full of fictional artefacts, things or products or inventions that do not actually exist. There is a way in which such artefacts can become reality as well. Jules Verne described the submarine, it seems, and the moon rocket. When he wrote these were merely fictional artefacts, but after his stories were published those things became realities as well. Did Verne invent the submarine? The orbital rocket? To me this is not obvious. It seems that here we do have reason to suggest that what got invented later were counterparts of the inventions in his story, unless of course he presented in his story the 'breakthrough' technology that made these things actually possible. (This point requires further elaboration.)

## The view that fictional entities are abstract objects

Some suggest that fictional entities or characters as such are abstract objects. Though not in obvious contradiction with what I said, this view sits ill with the way I have proposed to think of the situation. To my mind, it seems clear that Sherlock Holmes was intended as a concrete individual in the world of the fiction. What is gained by holding onto the idea that he is nonetheless an abstract entity? 

## Conclusions

I've argued that either we can't perform Briony's play, or Incapsulation is false. I've further shown how there is a clear reason to think that we can perform Briony's play, a reason rooted in the notation of such works.
