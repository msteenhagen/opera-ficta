# Fictional Works

In this paper I discuss the puzzling phenomenon of fictional entities that manage to enter into the real world. Some literary works tell us of pieces of prose or literature written by fictional characters, of pieces of music composed originally in a story, or of a poem imaginatively conceived on a Sunday afternoon in an East-Sussex farmhouse that does not actually exist. It seems uncontroversial that all such _fictional works_ could be reproduced, performed or recited within the story that contains them. The tragic lines Bethany writes in the opening chapter of McEwan's _Atonement_ are recited by her cousin a few pages later. But even further, to me it seems equally clear that those lines could just as well be presented to us outside the story. Can't I recite here the poem composed by a fictional character? Couldn't the London Review reproduce a letter that was written by and addressed to mere figments of the imagination? I think that it is obvious that if we got together and tried, we could at least make an attempt at performing the play Bethany wrote. In doing so, what seemed a fictional entity---a work created by a fictional character---manages with our help to enter into the actual world.

To my mind it is clear that this is a possibility. But it seems equally clear to me that there is something deeply puzzling about this. Typically, we assume that the world of the story and the actual world do not interact or are causally and historically insulated. In what follows I propose an explanation of this phenomenon. The explanation I want to propose points to the _abstract_ character of the works in question: all of them are _types_, artefacts created by people that allow, because of the kind of thing they are, for multiple instantiation. The main point I want to bring out is that the predicate 'fictional' and the qualification 'in the fiction'  do not apply at the level of types. But I show that this has the surprising consequence that some abstract entities can be invented by people that do not exist.
