# Fictional works

A short paper about fiction, abstractness, and reality.

## Abstract:

Many assume that fictional individuals are encapsulated in the world of fiction.  Yet some works of fiction tell us about pieces of prose or theatre written by fictional characters. Such creations are fictional works, as I will call them. Their authors do not exist. But we can perform, recite, or more generally generate actual instances of such works. This means we can bring such individuals actually into existence, as the works they are. I conclude that the assumption about encapsulation is untenable.

## Keywords:

fiction, fictional characters, repeatable works of art, types
